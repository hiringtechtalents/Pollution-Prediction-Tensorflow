This project was developed as a part of my college project for Environmental Impact Assessment.
It is based on Tensorflow Object Detection API: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection
For installation refer to: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md

This project detects different types vehicles (Cars, Motorcycles, Trucks, Buses) in a picture and calculates the level of pollutants (CO, CO2, HC, PM) using their Emission Factors.
